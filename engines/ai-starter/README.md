# Nextbase

Nextbase is a simple, fast, and secure way to build and deploy your next web application. It's built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). It is fully typed and uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which means you can build your app with confidence.

## Developing and deployment instructions

Please checkout the documentation site [here](https://usenextbase.com/docs).

## Note

This is a port of the Vercel AI Chatbot to Supabase. The original code is [here](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot).

The original code is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot/blob/main/LICENSE).

The original code uses plain postgres and next-auth. We use supabase for the database and auth.
