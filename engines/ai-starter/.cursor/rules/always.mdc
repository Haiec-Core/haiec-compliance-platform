If the request starts with "plan:", create a detailed step by step plan on how to do the request, no need to make any code changes.

If the request is "apply", then implement the plan that was previously created.

If the request starts with "apply migrations", run "pnpm supabase migrations up" and then generate types using `pnpm generate:types:local`
